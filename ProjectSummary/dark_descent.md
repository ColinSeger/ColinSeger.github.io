<!-- ### Dark Descent -->

**Dark Descent** is the second game project I was a part of at **FutureGames**.

The target platform was **Phone** and **Dark Descent** ran fine on our mobile device

The project was made in **Unity** and for audio we used **Fmod**.

I had fun making this project even thought the issues we faced.
