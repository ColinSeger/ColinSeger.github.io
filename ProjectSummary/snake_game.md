<!-- ### Snake Project -->

This was a project we had to learn UE5 and it's syntax. I was not the biggest fan of this
task, not that there was anything wrong with making a game in Unreal, rather it is mostly related to how up to that point we had been working on snake in pure **C++**. That made me quite tired of having to just redo my initial project in UE.
