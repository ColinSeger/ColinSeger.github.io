## What Is Osten Engine
Osten Engine is the custom engine that I started as a part of a assignment, the assignment was to make a 
game engine using Graphics API of your choice and at the end of the project you where supposed to make a game in that engine

So Osten Engine was made using Vulkan, GLFW and ImGui, I could have used more libraries but felt like I would be learning less if I did
so I keept the libraries I used to a minimum in a way to learn how to do as many things I could on my own.

The Game I decided to make using Osten Engine was a simple total war style army battler with very simple combat.

#### Rendering API

Made in Vulkan since I felt that if I'm to learn a rendering API might aswell learn one that is not to platform locked or discontinued,
I feel like that decision was probably good for me actually understanding all the steps of the renderpipeline since I had to read up alot to understand
how to use the things Vulkan provides in a competent way. But I will also say that if I had not gone for Vulkan I would probably have gotten way more done


#### Shadow Mapping
This was by far the thing I had the hardest time with, this came down to my inexperience in Vulkan and how many systems had to work well together
or have it come crashing down.
