## What is Real Fps

Real Fps is a game made during a 3 day game jam and the concept of the game is that 
the player is a UE4 character fighting against UE5 characters. Whenever the player
clears a level they get the choice on what graphics setting to reduce and that also
raises the frame rate cap by 10.
