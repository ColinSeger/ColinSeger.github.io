## What Is Project Liminal

Project Liminal is a school project that was intended to be a game that is replayable.
The way we tried to make that was via a friendslop game where the goal is to under pressure identify anomalies.
The way these anomalies reveal themself is that you and your friend will not be seeing the same thing. 

Visual Example:

![Example Image](/Images/LegacyImages/snow1.jpg)
![Example Image2](/Images/LegacyImages/snow2.jpg)

In this example a randomly selected player might see the first or second image displayed on a painting in the game.
While the others see the other example.
