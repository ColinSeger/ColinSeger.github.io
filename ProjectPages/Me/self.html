        I am a passionate programmer who was born early 2003, and has been programming on and off since 2015 but have been more into it since 2020.
        Some of the things I like looking into the most is optimizing code for better performance,
        This also is slightly fueled by how most software nowaday is way slower than it should be and just feel bloated and slow.

    <p>
        I am a programmer who loves to learn and specifically learn about how to make software faster while keeping time commitments low.

        One of my bigger projects lately is a Vulkan C/C++ game engine that you can read more on in the OstenEngine section of my portfolio.
