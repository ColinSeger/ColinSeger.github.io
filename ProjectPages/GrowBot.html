            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I had loads of fun during this project

                We suffered a causality at the beginning of this project in the sense of one programmer going missing.
                
                <br><br>
                We ended up with two active programmers and me being one of them had to work real hard during this project,
                the people I had to work with during this project had some great communication and where able to step up whenever we needed assistance.
                <br><br>
                
                We had to cut a lot of our initial idea as it included upgrades and a ability to swap arms with that did different things,
                we also had some vague ideas on some more visual destruction but that also got cut.

                <br><br>

                All in all this was probably the best game project I was part of mostly due to 
                how fun I had developing this game.

            <h3>My Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication is key</li>
                <li>What can be accomplished in a short time with effort</li>
                <li>That sacrifices on what can be done has to be done (When time is limited)</li>
            </ul>
